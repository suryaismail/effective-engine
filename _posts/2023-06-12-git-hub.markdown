### Creating a repository

This outlines the steps for create a repository for collaboration on GitHub

1. Create a github account at
https://github.com/

2. Download GitHub Desktop
https://desktop.github.com/

3. Create your Unity project as usual

4. In GitHub Desktop, create a new repository
  - Choose the folder ONE UP from where your Unity project is
  - Give your repository the same name as your Unity project
  - Select ‘Unity’ in the ‘Git Ignore’ section
  - Click Create Repository
  - Click yes for 'Initialize Git LFS'
  - Check the 'History' tab to see the list of Unity files

![Initialize Git LFS]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/initialize-git-lfs.png)
![GitHub Initial History]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/github-initial-history.png)

5. Click on 'Publish Repository'
  - Check your github account to see the new repository

### Committing and pushing code

Committing code means saving a version of it in your *local* repository. This means
you can alwasy go back to it at a later time, and you save a history of it.
But, since it's only on your local machine, other people can't see it.

Publishing and pushing code means sending your changes to a *remote* repository. There
are many repositories, but for us, we use GitHub as our repository.
